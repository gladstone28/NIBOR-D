**Introduction:** 

Bamboo is a great building product, but without preservative treatment, products made from bamboo can only be expected to last few years. Treatment of bamboo culm with Nibor-D can help maintain bamboo strength over time, help prevent 
termite attacks and help prevent decay. Nibor-D’s active ingredient is disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (DOT). Nibor- D has a 20% higher boron concentration than boric acid and is also far more soluble in water than boric acid, allowing for higher active concentrations – up to 15%.



### SIX MAIN TREATMENT METHODS

Bamboo must be treated from the inside out. It is best to treat when the bamboo is freshly cut but can be left standing 
for a few days if placed on blocks or stones. Use the anatomy diagram to identify the bamboo charateristics mentioned 
in the treatments. There are six main methods used to treat green bamboo (right)


### THE FOLLOWING ARE THE SIX TREATMENT METHODS:

1. Split the bamboo and dip treat the halves in a cement treating pool or metal dip tank 
with a 5% solution of Nibor-D. Mix 0.25 kg of Nibor-D for every 4 liters of water (1 lb. 
Nibor-D/gallon). Place the split halves in the tank and soak for 3-5 days

2. To treat whole culms, drill out the internodes with a drill bit wielded to a long piece of 
rebar, then dip treat in a 5% Nibor-D solution for 5-7 days

3. Another method for treating whole culms is to drill out all the internodes except the last 
one, then fi ll the bamboo with 10% Nibor-D solution and soak for 5-7 days

4. If the time required on the above methods is not available, you can treat split bamboo 
by soaking it for 1-2.5 days in a 10% Nibor-D solution, and whole drilled bamboo for 
2.5-3.5 days in the 10% solution Mix 0.50 kg of Nibor-D for every 4 liters of water (1 lb. 
Nibor-D/gallon)

5. Here is another method that can only be used with freshly cut bamboo: Fill a 50-gallon 
drum with a 10% Nibor-D solution. Mix 0.50 kg of Nibor-D for every 4 liters of water 
(1 lb. Nibor-D/gallon). Place the freshly cut bamboo in the Nibor-D solution and allow 
transpiration to take place (like fl owers in a vase). When the leaves at the top die, the 
Nibor-D has diffused into the culm

6. You can also use a 15% Nibor-D solution in a single dip with no soak time. Mix 0.75 kg of 
Nibor-D for every 4 liters of water (1.5 lb. Nibor-D/gallon). However, the borate will not 
be diffused through culm for several weeks


With all these methods, the solution mix can be reused. The DOT will settle over time but if you can mix it back into 
solution, you can continue to use it. Additionally, you can always check bamboo to see if it is treated by using our 
curcumin test: simply spray the bamboo and if it turns red or orange, it has been treated with boron at sufficient levels. 
If it turns yellow, the boron levels are too low. If you are setting up an ongoing treatment facility you will need to check 
the solution concentration regularly to make sure it remains at 5%, 10% or 15% using titration analysis equipment such
